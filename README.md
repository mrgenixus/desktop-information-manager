# Personal Information Manager
*Think of Outlook, but no, actually, way less than that"

## Caveat Lector
*this is strictly designed to work in Active Desktop on Windows and may not conform to open standards, cross-browser compatibilty guidelines and may not run on windows versions later than 98.*

## Missing Contacts
Originally, I had a number of personal contacts included in the source of these files; the files were generate by a FOXPRO for MSDOS script which I have since lost, as such, I stripped out the contacts. I'll probably be updating this so that it will run in webkit, and use Google API's to pull contact Data;

## Storage Format
This is early work, prior to mature development with XML, and at the time, using XML added significant overhead, no-only due to limited browser support, but due to this being prior to the development of most major Javascript frameworks, so-far as I am aware.

## Maintenance
This 'work' is intended as a demostration of code previously written, possibly close to ten years ago; it should be considered abandoned, at-best
